# SampL

Creating palettes that inspire.

## Summary

SampL is a design tool that helps designers and developers extract and view
vibrant color palettes from reference images. Given an image url, SampL
generates a palette and brings colors to life on the page. It allows the user to
see their palettes side by side and get an idea how their palette might affect
the page as a whole.

We built this App as a solution to a challenge we face as new developers quite
frequently. We found ourselves building quite a few small apps here and there to
put to practice all that we've been learning. While the purpose of most of these
projects is usually to practice some new technology, it is always important to
keep in mind the user's experience, a huge part of which is the visual design of
the app. SampL can be used to take some design pressure off of these projects by
providing an easy way to get a baseline palette. Just find an image in the
internet that captures the vibe of your user experience and extract the colors
for use.

## Setup

Clone(`git clone`) this repo to your local machine.
Navigate(`cd <subdirectory name>`) into the newly created directory.

### Set up your backend

This app will work as intended without setting up a backend. If you don't need
to worry about keeping persistent data, you can skip this step.

The save color palette data is stored in the `db.json` file and uses jason-serve
as a simple backend. To use this file, if you don't already have json-server
installed, in your terminal run `npm install -g json-server`. Then run
`json-server --watch db.json`.

### Set up your front-end

Open a new tab in your terminal and navigate into the directory. First run
`npm install` to install the node dependencies. Then run `npm-start` to view the
page.

## Features

- Color palette is generated from a user provided input.
- User can save and remove any number palettes.
- Site Theme shifts according to the selected palette.

## Code Snippets

We treated this app as a fantastic way of practicing writing clean code. We
limited repetition by refactoring our functions to operate differently depending
on the context in which we used them. That way, we could pass around one
function to multiple components which needed to perform similar but not
identical tasks.

```javascript
const toggleView = (palette = null) => {
  palette === "newPalette"
    ? setMainPalette(newPalette)
    : setMainPalette(palette);
};

const removePalette = (event, id) => {
  event.stopPropagation();
  const newPalettes = palettes.filter(palette => {
    return palette.id !== id;
  });
  setPalettes(newPalettes);
  deletePaletteFromDB(id);
};

const changeTheme = (event, colors) => {
  if (event) {
    event.stopPropagation();
  }
  setTheme(colors);
  colors.forEach((color, i) => {
    document.documentElement.style.setProperty(`--color${i + 1}`, color);
  });
};
```

## Feature Wishlist

- User can choose how many palettes to generate.
- User Sign-in and authentication
- User can add or remove colors from a palette manually.
- Export palettes for embedding.
- Provide all color format type (RGB & HSL)
